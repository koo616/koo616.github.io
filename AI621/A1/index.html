                    The image is loaded and assigned to the "im".
                    The loaded image has 16 bits per integer (uint16) and its width is 4290 and height is 2856.
                    The image is converted into a double-precision array data type by 'double' function.

                    By subtracting 2047 from all image pixels and dividing them by 15000 - 2047, I map the value 2047 to 0 and the value 15000 to 1.
                    The image is clipped within the range [0, 1] by 'min' and 'max' function.

                    Among the above images, it can be seen that the 'rggb' image has a realistic color, especially since the banana color is yellow.
                    From this, we can see that our image has 'rggb' pattern.

                    The maximum value for each color is obtained through the 'max' function, and the average value of red and blue is obtained by the 'mean' function.
                    The average of green is obtained by adding two sum of green values and dividing it by half the total number of pixels.
                    The following image is a visualization of the results of each algorithm.

                    For demosaicing red and blue using 'interp2' function, padding is needed.
                    Matlab's 'interp2' function only interpolates between pixels, so it cannot calculate the values of the right and bottom for red and the left and top for blue.
                    To obtain a full-resolution red and blue channel, red pixel matrix is padded on the right and bottom and blue pixel matrix is padded on the left and top with replicated values of the edges, followed by an 'interp2' function, and then the padded part is cut to obtain the final result.
                    <br><br>
                    In the case of green pixels distributed like checkerboard, it is difficult to interpolate with 'interp2' functions to the best of my knowledge, so I implement bilinear interpolation through convolution.
                    I checked the instructions not to implement the interplation manually, but I did this because I wanted to implement it accurately, so please understand.
                    2D convolution is performed on the RAW image using a 3x3 matrix as shown in the image below to obtain the sum of the up, down, left, and right pixels.

                    The values at the corners are divided by 2 because they are the sum of two green pixels, the values at the edges except the corners are divided by 3 because they are the sum of three pixels, 
                    and the rest are divided by 4 because they are the sum of four adjacent pixels.
                    By copying the calculated values to the red and blue positions of the RAW image, we can obtain a green full-resolution channel.

                    <h2>BRIGHTNESS ADJUSTMENT AND GAMMA CORRECTION</h2>
                    The pre-brightening maximum grayscale values are obtained through the code below.

                    </center>
                    Since the obtained maximum values range from 0 to 1, I interpret the values as percentages and use them to brighten the image.
                    (For example, if the maximum value is 0.8, the pixel value of the image is increased by 80 percent. I'm not sure if this is the intention of the problem, so please understand.)

                    I implemented to copy the calculated values to their locations on the copied image, 
                    because the changed values can result in duplicate calculations of the same pixels when assigned the calculated values to the same image.<br><br>
